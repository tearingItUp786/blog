This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by Sam Julien. Itâ€™s a simple snapshot of whatâ€™s going on in my life right now!

## Current Focus

I have three main focuses at the moment:

1. Cherishing time with my girlfriend after two years apart (boo, long distance).
2. Building up my [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://grapplecity.ca/) studio with my brothers.
3. Spending more time with people I love â€” and less time with people I donâ€™t.

## Personal

Iâ€™m transitioning from a long-distance relationship to a short-distance one -- it's about damn time; I missed her a lot. Lately, Iâ€™ve been trying to slow down and really appreciate family time, even just sitting around and shooting the breeze.
Those simple, unremarkable moments have started to feel like the most meaningful ones.

## Creative Work

I recently started a side project that Iâ€™m genuinely excited about.
I decided to give [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) a try â€” and wow, who knew PHP devs not only drive Lambos but also get a sick ass
full-stack framework ðŸ˜†? Iâ€™m only a couple of weeks into my first Laravel + Inertia + React project, and Iâ€™m blown away by the developer experience.
Iâ€™ve also been getting back into publishing newsletter updates â€” so keep an eye out ðŸ˜Ž.

## Day Job

Iâ€™m currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Best Buy Canada](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/about/about-us/blt6d2c74aaa5bd3e78),
where I divide my time between our in-house design system, the product details domain, and architectural improvements to our frontend codebase.
Iâ€™ve helped introduce practices that improved development speed and code quality across the organization.

More importantly, the people I work with are incredible â€” not just colleagues, but lifelong friends.

## Learning

Right now Iâ€™m learning:

- [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://grapplecity.ca/) â€” I coach it, but thereâ€™s always something new to learn.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) â€” Time to earn that Lambo.
