Be forewarned that _most_ if not all of the discussed design patterns will be
object oriented in nature. Despite this, the overall spirit of design patterns
can prove to be helpful to functional and procedural programmers alike. Before
we tackle the **how** of design patterns, it's important to determine the
**why**.

## Why design patterns matter

As, at the time of writing this, I admittedly have not given much thought to
design patterns for a variety of reasons. Including but not limited to:
JavaScript doesn't lend it self very nicely to object oriented design patterns
given its prototypical inheritance chain and the fact that during my day-to-day
tasks, I'm not often pondering "what pattern would work best in this scenario".
Regardless, as Bruce Lee once said, all knowledge is self knowledge... Thus,
learning about design patterns will, at the very least, help me learn more about
myself. Hippy dippy things aside, there are actual tangible benefits to learning
design patterns.

For example, naming a thing allows us to say more with less. When we use a
pattern in a description, it lets other developers know what design we have in
mind. Similar to how naming your child whilst still in the womb makes the whole
baby thing all the more real, so to is true for design patterns. Why the baby
example? My brother just had a kid so I've got babies on the brain ðŸ˜†.

Speaking design also allows us developers to stay in the design phase of our
solutions longer. Oftentimes, if you're anything like me, you're itching to
getting to typing... this however, can be counterproductive as we may end up
coding ourselves into a corner (I've done this before and it is **not** fun).
Another benefit to speaking design is that it allows the conversation to stay at
a higher level of abstraction and this is beneficial because developers who may
not be versed in the implementation language of the solution can still
contribute to the overall development of a solution. Inclusiveness is gooooood.

Lastly, knowing design patterns can open up career opportunities! If you're at
all interested in being a Solutions Architect, design patterns will become your
new best friend.

## How do I use design patterns

I would be remiss if I did not state this disclaimer: design patterns cannot be
implemented by a framework and they don't even exactly go into your code... they
go into your ðŸ§ . Once we've got a good working knowledge we can then apply these
patterns to our old code and prevent our new code from becoming a hodge-podge of
spaghetti.

## A reminder

When it comes to designs, there's a couple of things that we need to keep in
mind:

1. Program to an interface and not an implementation.
2. Favor composition over inheritance
3. Encapsulate what varies.
4. Too much abstraction isn't necessarily a good thing!
