**Yes, it is my birthday üéà**, but anyway this post isn't about that... or maybe
it is? Or maybe it can be...? hahaha no no! It's about attending conferences!
Long story short, if you have the opportunity to attend a conference, do it;
don't think, just do it! This year, I had the privilege of
attending&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.epicweb.dev/conf">Epic Web
Conference</TextLink> and it was an amazing experience. From the speakers to the
workshops, everything was well planned and executed. I learned so much and met
so many great people.

But _why'd_ I go (start with why, right)? Kent made the talks available online
for free. I could've just watched the conference from the comfort of my own home
instead of spending money to travel to beautiful Park City, Utah. Technically
true, but there's something special about being in the same room as the speakers
and other attendees. The vibe, undeniably, is different. It's like the
difference between watching a concert on YouTube versus being there in person.
The disparity in the energy is **incomparable**.

Beyond the differences of attending in person versus online, Kent's my boy and I
wanted to support him. I was the first person to
buy&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.epicweb.dev/buy">Epic Web Dev</TextLink>
and you can bet your bottom dollar I was the first person to buy a ticket out to
Utah! Don't belive me? Check out
this&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://youtu.be/URKySjEq5rk?t=462">clip</TextLink>
from Kent's office hours üòÜ!

## How I prepped

Taran, you _prepped_ for a conference that you were _attending_? Yes, yes I did.
I also talk in the third person. Deal with it. I wanted to make the most of my
time at the conference, so I did the unthinkable... I planned üò±!

<ShortQuote>You get out what you put in</ShortQuote>

Thanks to Kent's brilliant planning (and probably a handful of other folks from
behind the scenes), the conference was single track. I didn't need to do much
prep work to see which sessions I wanted to attend -- everyone was attending the
same sessions -- so I had limited amounts of FOMO (fear of missing out). I loved
this single track idea and yeah, sure, I didn't necessarily _need_ to watch the
presenter introductions before the conference... but I did, and let me tell you
why: I wanted to know a little bit about the people I was going to meet before I
actually met them! Cold approaches suck so anything that can be done to
metaphorically warm up the approach is a good idea üòÇ.

### My goals for the conference

I was lucky enough to have my employer cover the cost of my ticket for Epic Web
Conference and as such, I had added incentive to set up some goals for the
conference. Even if my employer didn't cover the cost, I would've set up goals
for myself. Here are the goals I came up with... you may notice a trend üôà:

1. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds">Kent C.
   Dodds</TextLink>
2. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/Madisonkanna">Madison
   Kana</TextLink>
3. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/chantastic">Michael
   Chan</TextLink>
4. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">Ryan
   Florence</TextLink>
5. Talk to <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/simonswiss">Simon
   Vrachliotis</TextLink>

It's abundantly clear üòÖ that my goals all centered around meeting and talking
to people. I had no idea what I was going to say to them, but I knew I wanted to
meet them! I wanted to humanize the people I've been following on Twitter
(technicallly X now) for ages because it's so easy to forget that there's a
super rad person behind the screen.

Now, despite being dubbed a social butterfly by my friends, and by a new friend
I made at the conference (my
boy&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/deriegle">Devin</TextLink>), I was
nervous as hell to talk to these rockstars. I mean, they're like the cool kids
in highschool and I'm just a pleb? Right?! Right?!!! Wrong lol.

That gif (and that's with a hard g) is a pretty accurate representation of how I
felt. However, framing meeting people at a conference in this way is a terrible
idea; _frame better, do better_! Thank God for Kent and his "you can sit with
us" attitude/t-shirt/sign. Seeing that sign reminded me that these people are
actually really sweet and approachable. They're not the cool kids in highschool,
they're the cool friends on Twitter that you've never met in person. Those
people and everyone else as the conference were
so&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://youtu.be/jjt9Qx9MBPk?t=22">fetch</TextLink> üòè!

Also, and this is more of a me thing, something that helped me deal with my
nerves with being in a new place with new people (in the States where the Second
Amendment is a thing), was training some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I'm not saying
that I was going to use my BJJ skills on anyone at the conference, but getting
my sweat on with a BJJ class let me get a feel for the people of Park City. I
know this is a cliche,
but&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://youtu.be/lPRZE5gJ_Vs?t=109">I believe you
really get to know someone after having fought them</TextLink>. I got to _kinda_
know Park City after having a few sparring bouts with my boys from BJJ
Revolution Utah.

## My experience

The conference was amazing. I met so many cool people and learned so much.
That's it. That's the post. Make sure you come in 2025 üòÜ.

### Everyone is a person

I met some of my heroes and "celebrities" in the web development space: Kent C.
Dodds, Una Kravets, Ryan Florence, Michael Chan, Theo. This was hella
intimidating at first. They were "somebodies" and I was a "nobody" -- or at
least that's what my anxiety had me thinking. But dude, and hear me out here...
intimidation is _so_ unnecessary when meeting people in or outside of industry!
Despite being "celebrities", they were all so easy to talk to. Hell, Kent upon
seeing me, gave me a big hug; it was so awesome üôèüèΩü§ó!

And you might be thinking, "Taran, of course they're people... everyone is just
a person". But it's easy to forget that when the person you're speaking with is
influential in your field and whose opinion carries weight in the community.
But, again, they're just people. They're just like you and me. The things we
talked about ranged from thoughts on Design Systems and Storybook's place in the
ecosystem, red flags in dating profiles (you're not 5'11" Madison), my awesome
beard, and how
amazing&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.inngest.com/">inngest</TextLink> is as
a solution for dealing with async jobs and events (Jessy was a major hype man
for this... but I don't have his twitter handle üòï).

<BlockQuote author="Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby">
  And \[that's why\] I like large parties. They‚Äôre so intimate. At small parties
  there isn‚Äôt any privacy.
</BlockQuote>

Not only was it dope meeting my heroes, but it was awesome meeting new friends,
friends that weren't "famous"! I can't list everyone but if you're not listed
here, I think you're famous üòÖ! Some awesome folks I met and had great chats
with: Devin, Devon, Harmony, Stephanie, Jessy, Brad, and Brendan. Of those
folks, I am especially thankful for being able to build up a great rapport with
Devin. Over coffee, we got into the thick of things! Beyond just tech and our
place in the industry, we discussed things like raising a family, values and
morals, and the nature of the human condition; it was one of my favorite
conversations during my stay in Utah üòÑ.

### Workshops

If your budget allows for it, I defnitely suggest that you go and check them
out! Thankfully, the one I attended was free so there was no excuse to not
attend. I learned
about&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity.io</TextLink> and its
combination with Hydrogen for setting up a storefront with Shopify. Don't expect
to pick up everything there is to learn about the technologies during a
workshop, but you'll get some **exposure** to something you can dig into later!

I never realized how _easy_ it was to get going with Shopify and creating my own
e-commerce store prior to this workshop. I'm not saying I'm going to quit my job
and start selling beard oil online (my
friend&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://github.com/mannyv123">Manjot</TextLink>
once thought we could do that for a living üòÇ), but I'm one step closer to being
_able_ to do that after that workshop
with&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/simeonGriggs">Simeon</TextLink>
and <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/kmelve">Knut</TextLink> üëÄ.

BTW, if you want to learn more about Sanity and Hydrogen, check out
this&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.sanity.io/learn/module/sanity-and-shopify-with-hydrogen/hydrogen-prerequisites">learning
article</TextLink> created by my friends from Sanity; it may or may not be the
same content we went over during the workshop day üßê.

### The Talks

**There was not a bad talk among the bunch**. The emcees were _damn_
great.&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/Madisonkanna">Madison</TextLink>
and&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/marktechson">Marc</TextLink> really
set the tone and overall vibe for the whole event. The playful banter between
Marc and Madison was not only hilarious, but it also helped to establish a
totally friendly and welcoming atmosphere. I messed up though and didn't get a
picture with them üò¢.

Kent's keynote set the spirit for the conference: He gave us examples of why the
web is great. The web is permissionless (I can deploy stuff anywhere and I don't
need to get "approval" from some governing body), the web doesn't break
(websites from 20 years ago still work ü§Ø!), and most importantly, the web is
you (us); a melting pot of ideas. It doesn't matter what you're using... there's
a place for you! Whether you're a PHP lambo dev or a plebian React dev, the web
has a place for you ‚ù§Ô∏è.

But okay, let's get into what I learned from the talks (otherwise my employer
isn't going to pay for me to go next year üò≠). I'm not going to go into detail
about each talk, but I'll give you a high level overview of what I learned from
a few of them!

#### CSS and HTML

Una Kravets' talk on CSS and HTML was super informative. I learned so much about
the future (and present day) of CSS and HTML and how great the web platform has
gotten. One day in the near future, we'll be able to ship native select elements
that we can easily style (no more having to create div soup to get a nice
looking UI for selects)! Another thing from this talk which was dope
was&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://scroll-driven-animations.style/">scroll driven
animations</TextLink>; I'm already using it on my site for the progress bar in
my blog posts! Moving away from JS driven scroll events to CSS will help unblock
the JS thread and improve the performance of our sites! Native `popover's` have
also
kinda&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover">come
our way...</TextLink> so dope; my brain melted.

```html:title=popover-example.html
<button
  popovertarget="my-popover"
  class="w-fit rounded bg-black px-4 py-2 font-bold text-white outline-dashed transition-all hover:bg-white hover:text-black hover:outline-1"
>
  Click me
</button>

<div
  popover
  class="h-1/2 w-1/2 items-center justify-center"
  id="my-popover"
>
  <div class="flex h-[90%] items-center justify-center">
    What's up friends!
  </div>
</div>

```

<Popover />

#### Accessibility and Web Dev

Another thing that I really enjoyed
was&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/a_sandrina_p">Sandrina
Pereira</TextLink>'s talk on Accessibility! My big take away from her talk was:
`Every click is an interaction but not every interaction will be a click`.

When it comes to developing for the web, we need to make sure that we're
considering all users; not just the ones who can see or use a mouse. If game
devs can make something like
`The Last of Us`&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://www.gameaccessibilitynexus.com/blog/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-low-vision-review/#:~:text=Final%20Thoughts,adding%20what%20was%20left%20out.">accessible
to blind players</TextLink>, we can sure as Hell make our websites accessible
for everyone üí™üèΩ (or we can at least try).

And if you're thinking "I already know how to make accessbile websites". Shut up
dude. Even Tanner Linsley, the creator of Tanstack \{Query,Router,Table\},
learned something new from Sandrina's talk! Namely, that the `aria-current`
attribute can be used to announce the current page in
a&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://github.com/TanStack/router/commit/430e8f1ff3501b856e1ea88053d30abb5e441fc0">navigation
menu</TextLink>.

#### Local Development

<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/ralex1993">Alex</TextLink> gave a talk on local
development and how we can almost sorta kinda but not really have a web app with
data colocated with the UI. Honestly, go check out this
<TextLink href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">website</TextLink> for more information
on this. I, unashamedly, need to rewatch his talk.{' '}

However, I did pick up some wisdom from this man, whilst waiting for our Ubers
in the hotel lobby. That is, "there are three elements to a talk; it can inform,
it can educate, and it can entertain; in \[Alex's\] experience, the most
entertaining talks are the most important". I'm gonna have to agree with him
here because some of the most talked about talks (try saying that 5 times fast)
were Ryan Florence's talk on `let vs const`
and&nbsp;<TextLink href="https://twitter.com/jacobmparis">Jacob's</TextLink>
talk on High Performance CRUD apps. I seriously recommend that you go check them
out (as well as the other talks from the conf), once the recordings are
avaialble.

### The Afterparty

Don't skip the mother trucking after party! It's so much fun and it'll help
solidify some of the relationships you helped create earlier on in the day. It's
super low pressure, everyone's just happy to be there, and if you're lucky,
there's fun games and karaoke!

I regret leaving as early as I did from the after party. Yes I was tired. Yes,
my social battery was running on empty. Yes, I missed home... but also, when is
the next time I'm gonna be in the same room as those wonderful folks again?
Probably not until next year... üò¢.

## Closing Thoughts

My time in web dev is up in the air. AI might take over, I might switch out of
the industry, I might open up a hot dog stand? Who knows! However, I won't
forget the fun times I had at Epic Web Conf. I truly hope I get to go back next
year.
