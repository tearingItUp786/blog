Hey y'all (most likely just me) but here's a high level overview of the things I
learned from the remote [egghead](https://egghead.io) worskhop I attended today.
[Here's a link to the repo](https://github.com/chantastic/react-suspense-course)

TLDR;

1. What is React Suspense and why it matters
2. React Suspense -- the meat of the workshop
3. Designing flexible components
4. Nuggets picked up from the workshop

## What is React Suspense and why it matters

Prior to the advent of Webpack and other bundlers, code-splitting -- the ability
to "split" our JavaScript bundles into mutliple chunks -- was something that was
not possible. However, thanks to the aforementioned tools, code-splitting is a
commonly used practice that helps to ensure that the JavaScript bundles that our
users receive are as small as possible; this equates to better performance! We
all know that the fastest code is no code... so less code means faster code üòâ.

For example if we have a Single Page Application (SPA), prior to React Suspense,
a common practice was to use a package like

[React Loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) to handle
splitting the various routes for said application\*. It would be wasteful to
load all the code for every route at initial load time/runtime because there
could be several routes that a specific user never ends up actually visiting --
what a waste üò±!

There is one thing that Suspense requires to work though: a cache! Currently,
there is no stable caching pacakge for React, but don't you worry, the React
team is working diligently on a package that will plug in and work with Suspense
when it lands. Why do we need react cache? Simply put, Suspense needs to know if
a promise has resolved so under the hood react cache will throw a
thenable(promise) and until the thenable has resolved, Suspense will show sort
of fallback.

Chances are if you've ever written a component that required data from some
external resource, you've made an API request for that data and you've rendered
your component with the data once it was fetched. However, once that component
had unmounted and been destroyed, the data that was tied to that component went
with it! If that component then would need to be mounted again, you'd have to
potentially make the same API request for the same data and while browsers have
implemented caches for network requests, that doesn't really help with our
components rendering! But with react cache, if the said data had been requested
earlier the data will be available in the in memory cache and there will be no
need to fetch the data from the network request üëç.

Once Suspsene and react-cache have stabilized, we will no longer need to worry
about the logic regarding async resource loading!

	reach.

## React Suspense -- the meat of the workshop

I'm just going to show the code and explain it below üòÅ.

```jsx:title=pokemon.js
import React from "react"
import { unstable_createResource as createResource } from "react-cache"

let PokemonResource = createResource(() =>
  fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/x").then(res => res.json())
)

export default function Pokemon() {
  return <div>{PokemonResource.read().name}</div>
}
```

<div>
	<br />
</div>

```jsx:title=index.js
import React from "react"
import ErrorBoundary from "./error-boundary"
const Pokemon = React.lazy(() => import("./pokemon"))

export default function() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<h1>...couldn't catch 'em all</h1>}>
        <React.Suspense fallback="Locating pokemon...">
          <Pokemon />
        </React.Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```

### pokemon.js

In this file we are creating and exporting a very simple component `Pokemon`.
This component is meant to display some data in a `div` -- not very inspired but
that's not the point of this blog post and it wasn't the point of the workshop
either.

On line 4 we're using the `createResource` function that we imported from
[react-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cache) and providing it with a
function as an argument. The caveat with the function argument is that it needs
to return a thenable; luckily, the modern `fetch` implementation that ships with
browsers or packages such as [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
provide us with thenable implementations.

Remember what I said above, we need to provide Suspense with a component that
will throw a thenable! Thanks to our `createResource` call, if we attempt to
read from the resource with read prior to the promise being fulfilled,
`createResource` will throw the promise and Suspsene will catch it and do what
it will... in this case, show some sort of fallback component or text.

### index.js

In this file, we see Suspense shine. There's two components that we need to be
paying attention to here: `ErrorBoundary` and `React.Suspense`.

#### ErrorBoundary

We'll start our discussion here as this component is higher up in the tree.
Remember how I mentioned above that Suspense expects the component it lazily
loads to throw a thenable? Well ErrorBoundary is a component that when an error
is thrown, it catches and responds to it. The reason why this component wraps
our Suspense component is if for whatever reason our lazily loaded component(s)
that Suspense wraps throws an error rather than returning a value or throwing a
promise, we need a way for our UI to react to this. ErrorBoundary is the
component that allows us to react!

_Please not that ErrorBoundary cannot be a functional component -- React
requires it to currently be implemented via a class_

```jsx:title=ErrorBoundary.js
import React from "react"

export default class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false }
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    this.setState({
      hasError: true,
    })
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return this.props.fallback
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}

ErrorBoundary.defaultProps = {
  fallback: <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>,
}
```

## Designing flexible components

A big piece of knowledge/wisdom I was able to pick up from this workshop regards
components in the post react age.

<BlockQuote>Each component should have one specific intent</BlockQuote>

What this means to me is that a button component's intent is to fire off some
click event once clicked; we leave it up to the user of the component to decide
what this click event will be. If we abstract this idea out even further, if we
have a component that is responsible for rendering a list of data, we should
allow the user of this component to dictate what the rendering function will
look like for a data item.

```jsx:title=index.js {8-14}
import React from "react"
import { PokemonList } from "./PokemonList.js"

function App(props) {
  return (
    <PokemonList
      as="ul"
      renderItem={pokemon => (
        <li key={pokemon.name}>
          <button onClick={() => alert(`You selected ${pokemon.name}`)}>
            {pokemon.name}
          </button>
        </li>
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

```jsx:title=PokemonList.js {13}
import React from "react"
import { unstable_createResource as createResource } from "react-cache"

let PokemonCollection = createResource(() =>
  fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon").then(res => res.json())
)

export function PokemonList({
  as: As = React.Fragment,
  renderItem = pokemon => <div key={pokemon.name}>{pokemon.name}</div>,
  ...restProps
}) {
  return (
    <As {...restProps}>{PokemonCollection.read().results.map(renderItem)}</As>
  )
}
```

Notice how on line 8 of `index.js` we have provided a renderItem property to the
`PokemonList` component. This type of inversion of control is called, at least
to the best of my recollection, dependency injection. Michael's feelings are
that any components that are iterable or iterate over some data should provide a
capability for its users to override the default rendering behavior for each
item. That's what the highlighted line in `PokemonList.js` is doing! As shown on
line 12, the renderItem attribute on props, which defaults to a function, allows
a user to define their own map function.

Another nice thing that `PokemonList` allows its users to do is decide what the
base container component should be; that's what the `as` property is! Similar to
what is done in styled components, we can say that a component should render
itself "as" another valid JSX component.

This kind of thinking when designing components will help the developer who has
to create resources (functions and components in React which are actually just
functions) that start general but allow for specificity.

## Little nuggets from the workshop

At the end of the workshop, Chantastic invited us all to ask some questions and
like most question and answer segements, this one was ripe with golden nuggets.
The following are 4 libraries that Micahel Chan (Chantastic) recommends to teams
he works with:

1. [ReachUI](https://ui.reach.tech/)
2. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
3. [Immer](https://egghead.io/courses/immutable-javascript-data-structures-with-immer)
4. [react-beautiful-dnd](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)
