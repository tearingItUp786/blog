## Context

I pride myself in being a caring and attentive partner. I set little reminders
to check in with my girl to see how she's doing; we have a monthly check-in that
we engage in where we report on the status of the relationship and how we're
feeling about things (üî• so hot right); and I do my utmost to try and deescalate
any situations if I'm ever feeling like it's getting a little _too_ heated.
There's good kinds of üî• and bad kinds of üî•, if ye know what I mean.

However, I am _far_ from perfect. One of the things I struggle with the most --
like a lot of you fine folks reading this article -- is pulling myself away from
the computer when I've entered the _flow_ state. If you don't know about the
_flow_ state, [this blog post](./08-a-mind-for-numbers) does a good job of going
over it and why it rocks! The TLDR is that you're in the zone and you don't want
to leave the zone because the zone is where sh\*t gets done. Now, if you add in
the inability to rip myself away from the screen when I'm in flow and an
emergency üö® in production, I'll almost always forget to message my girl that
I'll be working late. In fact, I probably will not be responding to any messages
she sends my way either so her "just checking in on how your day is going"
messages go totally ignored.

Again, I just said, I pride msyself in being a caring and attentive partner.
However, whilst flow state is a great thing, it's not the most important thing
in my life and human relationships matter **way** more to me than any issue in
production. Ignoring your partner is not a good thing (obviously) and in fact
and don't quote me on this but I swear I heard it from someone, but... being
ignored and feeling ignored is as bad for as you as smoking a cigarette! Again,
don'te quote me on this and when I Googled it, I couldn't find squat, but we're
gonna run with it because even if it's not true, it **really really** sucks
being ignored.

Alright, so me leaving my girl hanging is a no go and it has happened enough
times that I decided something needed to be done to address the problem... and
since I'm a developer, you can guess what I tried to do. That's _exactly right_,
I tried to use code to help me remain a `polite and caring` boyfriend ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Getting into some nitty gritty, for me, an ideal solution required the ability
to interrupt me during my flow state, be executable from the terminal, and be a
maintainable and shareable form of automation. Oh right, let's not forget, it
also needed to _not_ break the bank üí∞ -- I couldn't justify spending more money
on dev toys... at least for this fiscal year.

## The code (since I know that's what you want)

Before I show you the code, first and foremost, you'll need to set up a Twilio
account. If you're planning to use this script verbatim, you'll also want to set
up a WhatsApp number (which is also possible through Twilio) but be forewarned,
which means you'll need to open up a Facebook business account. There's not much
to worry about when it comes to having a Facebook business account -- I created
one to message my girlfriend, and I haven't had any flags come my way from Meta
