## Context

I pride myself in being a caring and attentive partner. I set little reminders
to check in with my girl to see how she's doing; we have a monthly check-in that
we engage in where we report on the status of the relationship and how we're
feeling about things (üî• so hot right); and I do my utmost to try and deescalate
any situations if I'm ever feeling like it's getting a little _too_ heated.
There's good kinds of üî• and bad kinds of üî•, if ye know what I mean.

However, I am _far_ from perfect. One of the things I struggle with the most --
like a lot of you fine folks reading this article -- is pulling myself away from
the computer when I've entered the _flow_ state. If you don't know about the
_flow_ state, [this blog post](./08-a-mind-for-numbers) does a good job of going
over it and why it rocks! The TLDR is that you're in the zone and you don't want
to leave the zone because the zone is where sh\*t gets done. Now, if you add in
the inability to rip myself away from the screen when I'm in flow and an
emergency üö® in production, I'll almost always forget to message my girl that
I'll be working late. In fact, I probably will not be responding to any messages
she sends my way so her "just checking in on how your day is going" messages go
totally ignored.

Again, I just said, I pride myself in being a caring and attentive partner.
Whilst flow state is a great thing, it's not the most important thing in my life
and human relationships matter **way** more to me than any issue in production.
Ignoring your partner is not a good thing (obviously) and in fact -- and don't
quote me on this but I swear I heard it from someone -- being ignored and
feeling ignored is as bad for as you as smoking a cigarette! Again, don't quote
me on this and when I Googled it, I couldn't find squat, but we're gonna run
with it because even if it's not true, it **really really** sucks being ignored.

Alright, so leaving my girl hanging wasn't an option anymore. I needed a
solution that could pull me out of the flow state gently but effectively and
ensure I stayed the caring and attentive partner I aspire to be.

As a developer, the obvious choice was to code my way out of this problem. After
all, if tech can solve production emergencies, why not relationship ones too?
Enter Script Kit and a little help from Twilio. Here's how I hacked my way out
of the dog house and into "legendary" boyfriend status.

  const contentSid = await env('TWILIO_CONTENT_SID')

  const workingLate = await arg('Are you working late', ['yes', 'no'])

  if (workingLate === 'no') {
    console.log("Okay, won't text babe!")
    process.exit()
  }

  // Initialize Twilio client
  const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken)

  // Function to send a message
  const phoneNumber = await arg(
    "Enter the recipient's phone number (e.g., +1234567890):",
    numbersToText,
  )

  const messageBody = await arg(
    "Enter when you'll be free... He'll be free around <your message>",
  )

  console.log('Last time given', messageBody)

  client.messages
    .create({
      // body: messageBedy,
      contentVariables: JSON.stringify({1: `${messageBody}`}),
      from: `whatsapp:${fromNumber}`,
      contentSid,
      to: `whatsapp:+1${phoneNumber}`,
    })
    .then(message => {
      notify(`Message sent to ${phoneNumber}! Message SID: ${message.sid}`)
      console.log(`Message SID: ${message.sid}`)
    })
    .catch(error => {
      notify(`Error sending message: ${error.message}`)
      console.error('Error:', error)
    })
} catch (err) {
  console.error('There was an error running the twilio script')
  console.error('Error', err)
}
```

## The Setup

So before we jump into [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us), I think you
should go read my blog post about [Script Kit](./15-scriptkit/)! I'll wait.
Okay, you probably didn't read it so I'll give you the TLDR. The TLDR; is that
it's a scripting platform intended to help developers automate tedious parts of
their workflow. BTW, if you're reading this babe, nothing about you is tedious
üò∞. I swear, if this blog post gets brought up in a future fight, even as a
joke, this is going to be me:

### Why Twilio?

Now, I needed a reliable way to send a perfectly-timed text to my girlfriend.
Sure, I could've stuck with reminders, but where's the fun in that? Twilio came
to the rescue with its robust API, making it effortless to send SMS messages
programmatically. It fit seamlessly into my Script Kit workflow, bridging the
gap between code and communication.

So this isn't a blog about [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/company) but if
you haven't heard about it before, it's a cloud communications platform that
allows you to send not only emails and SMS messages programmatically, but also,
and this is relevant to my blog post, `WhatsApp` messages üëè! I went with Twilio
over another provider because I've got experience with their platform and they
had the coveted `WhatsApp` integration that I needed.

The setup for Twilio is as following:

- Sign up for Twilio.
- Get a phone number (~$1.15 USD).
- Add funds for messaging (~$0.025 per WhatsApp message).

The things you'll need to run the script from Twilio can be found in the
dashboard. They are the following:

- Account SID
- Auth Token
- Phone number

<InlineImage

	containerClassName="mx-0 lg:mx-0"

	alt="A screenshot of the twilio dashboard with my info blurred out"
/>

If all you're wanting to do is send SMS messages, you're all set. You'll just
need to tweak the script and remove any references to `whatsapp` in the `from`
and `to` fields in the `create` method (line `70` and `72` respectively)! If
you're running the full gambit, you'll also have to create a `WhatsApp Sender`
inside of Twilio.

From what I recall, the only _difficult_ part, and I use the word _difficult_
liberally here since nothing is really all that hard when it comes to this
automation, is creating your Facebook business profile. I called my business
Taranveer Bains Business -- that's it, just my name, followed by business üòÜ.
Assuming everything goes well with creating Facebook business and your
`WhatsApp Sender`, the next thing you'll most likely _want_ to do, is create a
whatsapp template. The primary benefit I've seen with using the template versus
a traditional message is that by using a template, your recipient will not have
to save your phone number in order to receive messages. For example, when I
tried to message my own phone number with my automation, I wasn't able to
actually _receive_ the messages until I had saved the number in my contacts.
This wasn't great because I didn't want to create unnecessary work for my girl.
There were a few other issues I ran into but I'll cover them later. Check out
the video below to see how easy it is to create a message template!

## The issues I ran into

Okay so this one is on me for not knowing the limitations of the platform, and
this makes perfect logical sense: Twilio stop sending my messages to my gf. This
happened, not because I voided their terms of service or anything like that, but
because, my gf didn't respond to any of my messages. This most likely flagged my
messages as "spammy" because I was broadcasting one way and not getting any
engagement.

**The fix to my messages not being delivered was to ask my gf to respond every
time she got a message**. That isn't the ideal fix but it'll do for now.

### Next steps

Like I said, it's kinda lame that my gf has to respond to my Twilio number to
stop the number from being flagged. It's also lame that she sends a message to
the number and that's the end of it -- it just goes straight into the void ‚ö´.
It would be super cool if I had a way of receiving said messages so that I know
it was delivered and that she's actually cool with me working late. From what I
gather, it actually isn't all that hard to set up a service to do this. From my
cursory research, it seems like I need to associate a webhook with my number in
the Twilio dashboard and have a server sitting somewhere listening for messages
and then performing some action when a message comes through. Now... if only I
had a server running somewhere where I could do this ü§î. Oh wait! I have my
remix site (the one you're reading this post on), so maybe I can just create a
resource endpoint here and be about my business.

I haven't done it yet, but that's the plan. I'll come and update this blog post
once I've done that part!

## Closing thoughts

Scripting isn't just about automating tasks or writing clever code‚Äîit's about
reclaiming time and mental bandwidth to focus on what truly matters. Whether
it's sending messages to your girl one or streamlining repetitive workflows
(like checking if your enterprise company's website version has updated),
automation is a tool that empowers us to be more present, thoughtful, and
efficient.

Shout out to my girl for being the love of my life and inspiring this automation
‚ù§Ô∏è.
