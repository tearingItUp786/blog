description: I finally rewrote my blog (again) with a modern framework
tag: React
---

I've been working on websites for the past 7 years, and throughout those years,
some things has stayed consistent: I've always had a blog and there's always
been something new to learn. Whether or not I've consistenly written content on
my blog, though, is another story (I haven't); but I've always had one!

Let me walk you through the evolution of my blog, starting from 2015 and how we
ended up here!

## The Why

First and foremost, let's establish why I rewrote my blog (again) in 2023. My
previous iteration was written in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and I was
pretty happy with it. It was fast, it was easy to write, and it did everything I
needed a basic blog to do.

However, I was starting to get a bit bored of it, Gatsby had fallen out of
favor, I wanted to try something new, and thanks to the massive lay-offs in big
tech, I had some time on my hands üòÖ. Moreover, I'm noticing a shift in the FE
landscape where the lines between the backend and the frontend are starting to
get a little bit blurry so it kinda made sense to pick up a project that would
get me some exposure üí® --

.

## The Evolution

When I first started getting into web development, my first project, like many
others who are starting out today was a blog! However, back then (circa 2014), I
didn't know JavaScript all that well and the JavaScript that I did know was all
jQuery. Creating a fancy, slick looking site was beyond my abilities and I
didn't have all the modern day niceities that we have today (tailwind was not a
thing, webpack wasn't even on my radar, and don't even get me started on the
state of React).

So I did what I could. I started before I was ready and with the tools that I
had at my disposable: HTML and CSS. My old site is still available and hosted
for free at my [alma-mater](https://www.sfu.ca/~tbains/old_site/html/home.html).

/>

It's not much to look at and it's not mobile friendly, but it is one thing for
damn sure, besides cringey: performant. You can't get much faster than vanilla
HTML and css, and it's one of the primary benefits of the
[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/). Unlike my second iteration of my
blog (which is no longer up), there's also minimal security concerns with these
HTML files. My old server got hacked and became a zombie sending people spam
emails üòÖ because I failed to keep it updated.

## 2023 rewrite

Here's the list of things involved with my rewrite:

#### Written with:

- TypeScript: a typed superset of JavaScript
- React: my go to ui library
- Remix: my full stack framework of choice
- Redis: an in-memory data structure store and cache
- Tailwind: a utility-first CSS framework for building responsive web interfaces
- PostCSS: a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins
- Octokit (grqphql): a GitHub API client library for GraphQL queries
- Unified: a toolkit for parsing, manipulating, and serializing content
- MDX Bundler: a bundler for MDX (Markdown + JSX) files

#### Serviced used:

- Fly.io: a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your
  users.
- Github actions: a workflow automation tool for GitHub repositories
- Algolia: a search as a service platform
- Cloudinary: a cloud-based media management platform
- Metronome: analytics data of your Remix projects from top to bottom
- Cloudflare: a content delivery network (CDN) that provides caching services

Each one of the services listed above and diagramed in my architecture
exaclidraw are more than worthy of having their own blog post so I'll just focus
on the ones that were new to me or ones that made me go "huh, guess I need
this".

## Redis

As you may have guessed, I am using Github as my CMS and their API gave me quite
a lot of trouble; well, not really the API, but I was was using it gave me
trouble. Originally, I copypastad the methods Kent C. Dodds had written in his
blog project for querying Github. I didn't understand why Kent was using the
`cachified` library for his API requests and so I decided to strip cachified out
from my implementation (boy was that a bad idea üòÖ) because I thought I didn't
need it.

Not only were my pages loading slower than I wanted (upwards of 10 seconds for
my til page), but I would hit the rate limit for the API within a few minutes of
local development üò±. During Kent's office hours, I asked him how I could
address this problem and when I showed Kent my implementation, he lol'ed. Turns
out, I had stripped out the layer that was needed for performance -- the redis
cache!

I brought back cachified and started using redis to as my caching layer for 3rd
party requests and boy, I gotta say, that was a real improvement to my page
speeds! `cachified` makes it super easy to plug in redis/redis like databases
and so I was off to the races within minutes!

## Octokit

The above was the first real problem I experienced when creating my full stack
remix app: I had nothing caching the API calls to third parties and because of
this, the performance of my site suffered. However, more importatnly I had
forgotten one of my core tenants of programming: code we cannot understand is
code we cannot trust.

I didn't understand Kent's implementation for interfacing with the Octokit and
therefore ditched key elements that I actually needed. I decided to abandon the
idea of reusing Kent's code for querying Github and decided to do my own
technical discovery. As you could image, my discovery was quite fruiful because
it landed me on the Github Graqhql API. The Graphql API made it easy to
recurisvely query data from Github with one request (the TIL and blog pages on
my site require recursive querying and this was a pain in the butt with the Rest
API) and so the liklihood of me hitting the Github API rate limit diminished
greatly üéâ!

## Unified + MDX Bundler

So as I mentioned above, my last iteration for my blog was written in Gatsby.
Gatsby was great for a myriad of reasons: it let me write my website in React,
it had an awesome developer experience, and there were a whole host of plugins
at my disposable.

When I came over to Remix, a lot of the goodies I had in Gatsby RE MDX didn't
really exist for me anymore üòÖ. Some of the plugins I used were written
specifically for Gatsby and they didn't have a one to one port over to a
platform like Remix -- this also became an opportunity for more self growth
though üòè! Morever, while Remix has
[built in support for MDX](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) at build
time and, don't get me wrong, it's great, I didn't see point of doing a rewrite
of my blog with a fullstack framework if I was not going to do anything
substantial with my server!

Thankfully, Kent C. Dodds worked on the `mdx-bundler` and so I was able to
actually bundle my mdx and run-time (yay, I got to use my server to do some
processing!) üòä. While mdx-bundler gets the job done, there were some oddities I
noticed. For example, whenever I run `prettier` on my MDX files, my `TextLink`
component renders in a separate paragraph. Even though my `TextLink` was
supposed to be inside the regular flow, contained in the preceeding paragraph,
the combination of prettier and mdx-bundler casued it to be added to its own
paragraph tag. Owing to this, I just opted not to run prettier on my MDX files;
not great, but oh well ü§∑.

Remember when I mentioned like one paragraph ago that I had an opportunity for
more self growth when working with MDX and my Remix site? Well, let me
elaborate!
[Gatsby has a plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-code-titles/)
that allows developers to associate titles to their remark code blocks and it's
great (if you're usin Gatsby) but there is no remark counterpart that exists üò±!

However, there was something that was close to what I needed:
[rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles).
This rehype library basically did the same thing as the Gatsby version, but
didn't support the ability for a custom separator for the title string. After
some encouragement from Kent, I made my first PR and became a contributor to the
library üéâ. The
[issue link](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles#contributors-)
describes basically what I did and the reason why I needed to add it to the
library.

**Contributed to open source; I call that growth üòé**

## Cloudflare

<Callout

/>

The unexpected foot gun ü§£. The short version of this story is that the extra
DNS hops and the attempt to use the Cloudflare as my CDN actually negatively
impacted my page score lol.

## Remix

Remix is my chosen full stack framework for writing web applications and
websites, or at least it is at the time of writing this blog post. Now don't get
me wrong, there are a plethora of full stack frameworks to choose from and
they're all good in their own regard, offering their own respective set of
tradeoffs, but I am partial to Remix not only because it offers a seamless and
amazing developer experience but also because it remixes the base principles of
web development I learned about when I first started my career with the modern
developer experience, and frameworks I've come to love.

I'll be honest, it was a bit of a mental shift to have to start thinking about
my web app from the perspective of the server and the client. When I first got
started, well if I remembering correctly, I had issues understanding how to
properly read from `localStorage`, the `window` object being undefined whenever
I tried to access it, and the most annoying thing, I keep running into hydration
issues üòÖ. Now let me be clear, none of these issues are isolated to Remix alone
-- it's just the nature of working with React at the server and client level.
Owing to my own, inexperience, I ran into these issues and I _eventually_
figured them out.

Regardless, using Remix has been an absolute joy and I've had so much fun
migrating my site to this stellar framework. Lots of learning, lots of late
nights, and lots of stress -- but good things all around üòç.

## Closing Thoughts

This migration was tough, but most things in life that are worth doing, tend to
be on the difficult side. I can tell I grew a lot from this migration and it's
not only helped me become a better developer, but also a better engineer, and
overall problem solver.
