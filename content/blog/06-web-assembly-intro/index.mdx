## The why

True to form, I like to start with why (something I picked up from Simon Sinek)
and thus, a question that I was wanting to have answered in this workshop was
why should I, as a Front-end Engineer, care about WebAssembly (WASM).

In a nutshell ðŸŒ°, WASM is a low-level language that is meant to be a compile
target for high-level languages. It is designed to be portable and ran in many
different environments. It's a _compliment_ to JavaScript... not a replacement,
ye damn trolls ðŸ‘¹. Admittedly, my day to day is spent working in one of the
highest of the high-level languages (JavaScript) but the "high-level" languages
referred to above would be language such as C++, Java, Rust, etc.

At the time of this blog post, all major browsers ship with a

[WebAssembly global object](https://mzl.la/3sgLt4m) that allow us to load in and
utilize WASMs.

So again, why, as a Front-end Engineer, do I care about the fact that people who
know Rust and other traditionally non client side languages can now ship code
that can run in the browser? The answer is simple: we can now offload work that
JavaScript has been historically terrible at to a module written in a more
memory efficient and battle tested language.

Listen, I love JavaScript, but like all things in the world, it has its
shortcomings; never forget, `[] == ![]` evaluates to true... how the heck does
the empty array equal the parody of the empty array ðŸ¤£. I mean, I know why and
I'll post it at the bottom of this article, but if you're just picking up the
language and you saw this piece of code, you'd maybe just say, "fuck it, I don't
want to JS". So WASM make senses for things that require memory efficiency and
powerful computing capabilities, including, but not limited to:

1. Graphics
2. Compression
3. Video/Image Processing
4. Physics simulations

During my day to day, I don't have to worry about creating amazing visual
animations or processing massive images to create unique browser experiences,
but I do know that if I tried to do this in native JavaScript, the experience
and the resulting code would be clunky and bug ridden.

## For the JavaScripter who wants to write WASM

If you're like me and other Front-end Engineers, you're probably proficient with
JavaScript and know a little bit about another language but not enough to do any
crazy hectic computing with that secondary language. So how does someone like
myself get started with WASM without having to put in the backbreaking work of
refamiliarising myself or learning a new programming language? The answer:

[AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)

AssemblyScript is a variant of TypeScript that allows us to easily compile to
WASM without learning a new language (yay) ðŸ˜Š! That being said, this doesn't
mean, assuming you're someone who hasn't delved into languages like C/C++, that
we don't have to learn some new things and think about our programs differently.
The big thing that WASM and AssemblyScript ask of the programmer is to think
about memory allocation and how said memory is being used; if you're a native JS
dev, you've never probably had to think about garbage collection and efficiency
(unless you're a performance engineer).

Here's an example of what I'm talking about:

```JavaScript
// somefile.js
export function minusOne(n) {
  return n - 1;
}

// assembly/index.ts
export function minusOne(n: i32): i32 {
  return n - 1;
}
```

Did you notice the difference? It was subtle! The second `minusOne` had the type
parameter for the `n` argument set as **i32** and the return type as **i32**...
but what the heck is **i32?**. Essentially, the **i32** is a data type defined
in WASM and it stands for 32-bit integer. In JavaScript, we're generally not
thinking about how many bits comprise our numbers... a number is a number,
right? No. Not right. Even if we've never thought about it, the fact remains,
the JavaScript `Number` type is actually a 64 bit signed floating point number;
this means numbers in JavaScript can't be greater than 2^53 - 1 (it's not 2^64
because some bits have to be reserved for headers etc).

WASM and AssemblyScript **demand** that the programmer think about memory
allocation and memory efficiency... it comes with the territory.

Enough about the theory, give me some code...

## Example

### Step 1 - installs

I'm assuming you have the latest version of node installed (we need a version >
14). Create a new directory to huck all this code.

```bash
$ mkdir ./wasm-fun && cd ./wasm-fun
$ npm init --yes
$ npm i --save-dev assemblyscript
$ npx asinit .
$ npm run asbuild
# need this for serving content since we need
# to set a header of application/wasm on wasm files
$ npm i express
```

### Step 2 - The files

Your directory structure should look something like this

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ asconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ assembly
â”œâ”€â”€ build
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tests
```

In the `package.json` make these changes so that we utilize the glue code that
comes with the AssemblyScript loader:

```JSON:title=package.json
"asbuild:untouched": "asc assembly/index.ts --target debug --exportRuntime",
"asbuild:optimized": "asc assembly/index.ts --target release --exportRuntime"
```

In the `assembly` directory, copy this into index.ts

```ts:title=index.ts
export function minusOne(n: i32): i32 {
  return n - 1;
}
```

In the root create the following files:

```JavaScript:title=loader.js
// Basic interface to abstract away loading logic (glue code essentially)
class WasmLoader {
  constructor() {
    // functions we want available as globals to wasm modules
    this._imports = {
      env: {
        abort() {
          throw new Error("Abort called from wasm file");
        },
      },
      index: {
        log(x) {
          console.log(x);
        },
      },
    };
  }

  async wasm(path, imports = this._imports) {
    console.log(`fetching ${path}`);

    // loader being the assembly script loader that we imported in index.html
    if (!loader.instantiateStreaming) {
      return this.wasmFallback(path, imports);
    }

    const instance = await loader.instantiateStreaming(fetch(path), imports);

    return instance?.exports;
  }

  // since safari doesn't have great WASM support
  async wasmFallback(path, imports) {
    console.log("using fallback");
    const response = await fetch(path);
    const bytes = await response?.arrayBuffer();
    const instance = await loader.instantiate(bytes, imports);

    return instance?.exports;
  }
}
```

```JavaScript:title=server.js
// this is needed so we can serve application/wasm
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// Serve static files from root (note: do not do this in production code)
app.use(express.static('./'))

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server up on port 3000!'));
```

```html:title=index.html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <div id="main"></div>
  <!-- Need this to actually be able to use assembly script in the browser -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@assemblyscript/loader/umd/index.js"></script>

  <script src=/js/loader.js></script>
  <script>
    const WL = new WasmLoader();
    WL.wasm('/build/optimized.wasm')
      .then(instance => {
          const { minusOne } = instance;
          document.write(minusOne(44));
      });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3 - build and run

First, use node to run your server with `node server.js` so that when you hit
localhost:3000, you'll be served something.

Then, we need to actually compile our wasm code so run `npm run asbuild`.

Finally, visit `localhost:3000` and behold the glory.

## Closing Thoughts

WASM is a pretty damn cool idea that will make web applications way better in
the future! But, again, like a lot of things in computer science, it depends on
the use case. If I were to create a case management application, for example, it
may be more performant to do it in AssemblyScript but not as programatically
friendly as something done in JavaScript/TypeScript. However, if I was making
something like a virtual tour viewer like for a museum or something, I'd
consider doing some of the processing in WASM and the navigation or other items
in JavaScript.

#### **What's going on with `[] == ![]`**

1. Remember that there is operator precedence
2. First the ! Operator does Boolean([]) which evaluates to true
3. Then the negate operator says: I need to give you the parody of this value
4. So now the right side is false
5. So what we have is [] == false.

Now both left and right are coerced into Number as == prefers numbers. So what
we get is 0 == 0.
