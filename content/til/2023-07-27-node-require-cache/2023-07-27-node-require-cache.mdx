TIL that `commonjs` has a `require` cache. Basically, if you require a module
once in the file, it gets cached and if you attempt to require the module a
second time, EVEN IF THE CONTENT HAS CHANGED, you'll get the cached version.

Usually this isn't a problem but it bit me in the butt when I moved my remix app
over to be using express. I had to call this function inside of my server code
when remix finished rebundling.

```tsx
function clearRequireCache() {
	Object.keys(require.cache).forEach(function (key) {
		delete require.cache[key]
	})
}
```
