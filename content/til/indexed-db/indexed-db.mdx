This technology has been around for a while (> 3 years) and I haven't used it personally, but it's pretty damn slick. IndexedDB is a low-level API for client side storage. It's more popular brother, `localStorage` has its limitations and if you're 
ever running into them, you might want to take a look at `IndexedDB`. In a nutshell, `IndexedDB` is a transactional database system that allows us to permanently store data inside a user's browser. It would be useful for applications that store a large amount of data and 
applications that don't need persistent internet connectivity to function. 

Keep these key things in mind:

- It stores key-value pairs. 
- It's built on a transactional database model.
- The API is mostly async.
- It's object-oriented 😲. 
- It's not SQL
- It adheres to the same origin policy.
