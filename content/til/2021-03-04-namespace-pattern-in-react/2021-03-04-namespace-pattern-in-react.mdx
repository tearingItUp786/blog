title: Namespace pattern in React

So I've seen this pattern around but didn't know it had a name! If you've ever
used Context in React, you're aware of there being a `Provider` and a `Consumer`
and those two are namespaced to a specific Context. Keep in mind, this is
assuming you're using React < 16.8.0.

I'm still trying to figure out when this _should_ be used.

```jsx:title=namespace-pattern.js
const SomeContext = React.createContext()

const SomeContextProvider = ({children}) => {
  const [yolo, setYolo] = React.useState(false)

  // highlight-next-line
  return <SomeContext.Provider>{children}</SomeContext.Provider>
}

const SomeContextConsumer = ({children}) => {
  return (
    // highlight-next-line
    <SomeContext.Consumer>
      {context => {
        if (context === undefined)
          throw new Error('Must be used within a SomeContextProvider')

        return children(context)
      }}
    </SomeContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```
