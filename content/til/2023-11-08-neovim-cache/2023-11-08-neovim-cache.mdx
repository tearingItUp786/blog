If you're ever having issues with neovim, it might help to clear out the cache.
I recently was running into issues after switching from `packer` for my
dependency management to `lazy` and there was a sneaky little devil ðŸ˜ˆ in the
cache directory causing issues.

You can view the cache directory here: `$HOME/.cache/nvim/`.
