I'll be honest, up until today, I never really cared about character encodings
and didn't ever bother to learn anything about them... what a huge mistake!
Character encodings are the unsung heroes that allow us to display languages
(besides English) reliabely on computer systems.

The gist of UTF-8 is that it is an encoding that allows us to take Unicode code
and map said codes to meaningful linguinstic representations. Codes that are
between 0 and 127 occupy 8 bits -- a single byte -- and then any codes above
this upper bound can use up to 6 bytes. The beauty of this system is that
strings encoded in UTF-8 look exactly the same as strings encoded in ASCII.
Americans are chilling and don't need to worry about squat, while the rest of
the world has to "jump through hoops" to make sure that they're alphhabet will
work across computer systems.
