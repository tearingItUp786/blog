While working my way through _The Pragmatic Programmer_ I came by a tip that
really struck a chord with me. **Good design is easier to change than bad
design.**

Make things _easier to change_. Why is decoupling good? By isolating concerns,
we make each easier to change. Why is the single responsibility principle good?
A change in requirements is mirrored by a change in one module.
