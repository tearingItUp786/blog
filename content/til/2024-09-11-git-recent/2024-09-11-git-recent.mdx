TIL about `git recent` by Paul Irish. It's a command that shows you your latest
local git branches! Super useful when you're at work and got a lot of stuff on
the go.

```bash
 git recent

# example output
:'
* main                         7167899 (19 hours ago) Taranveer Bains
                               new til
