TIL about the following...

```css:title=inset-property.css
    /* top, left, right, button, are all set to to the same value */
    .box {
      inset: 0;
    }
```

1. The `inset` property is a shorthand for `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`
   properties.
2. Absolute elements can only be contained by other elements using Positioned
   layout.
3. Positioned elements will always render on top of non-positioned ones
4. [Stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context)
   is the stacking order of elements that are positioned.
   - We can create a stacking context by combining a non-static position with a
     z-index. So position `absolute` and `z-index` will create a stacking
     context.
   - We can also create one by setting opacity to less than 1.
   - Check out the link above for more info.
5. The `isolation` property allows you to create a stacking context. We can add
   this to a parent element and then we can forget about having to add a
   `position: relative` and `z-index` to the children. It is the lightest weight
   way to create a stacking context.
6. The `z-index` property can be used in a flexbox the same way as it can be
   used with a positioned element.
