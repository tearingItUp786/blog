So here's a nice little thing I'm going to try and get people using at work! <TextLink href="https://plopjs.com/">PLOP js!</TextLink>

Essentially, it allows us to keep our project structure consistent by creating a CLI tool
that will help automate the creation of files that should exist for various modules in our codebase.
For example, if we are creating a `React` component, a structure that we'd like to enforce in order to keep
our project neat and tidy is:

1. componentName > file name
2. componentName > index.js
3. componentName > \_\_tests\_\_
