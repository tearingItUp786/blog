title: every returns true for empty arrays

`every` on the JavaScript Array object is great since it checks to see if a
given callback function is true for _every_ value in the array... but there's
some caveats to it. Namely, `every` will return true for the empty array, and it
does not take into consideration empty slots during its processing.

Refer to the following code to get an understanding of the caveats:

```js
const isNumber = (v) => typeof v === 'number'

[].every(isNumber) // true
[1, ,2].every(isNumber) // true
[1, null, 2].every(isNumber) // false

```
