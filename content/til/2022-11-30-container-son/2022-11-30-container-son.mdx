TIL that there's a sick new css feature dropping soon: `container queries`. I haven't played around with them much myself 
but based on what I've seen, they allow developers to now not only make layout changes via css based on the viewport 
but also based on the size of an elements containining element.

A lot of people are pretty hyped about this feature and calling it the next evolution of responsive design on the web.
