After being laid off from Productboard, I've been spending time thinking about how I want to continue with my career and what to do with my spare time.
Of course landing a job is my priority, but during my time off, I want to devote time to learning skills and technology that I've never 
been able to make the time for in the past. 

One thing I've always wanted to do (for the "by the way factor") was setting up vim for my local development work. I devoted the entire day 
today to set up my neovim config; I'm pretty happy with it so far.
