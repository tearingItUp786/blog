title: Components and Inversion of Control

A neat little concept that I learned about (just briefly) today is this idea of
inversion of control. Essentially, assuming that we're talking about React/Vue
components, instead of having a mega component that accepts several different
props to handle various things like position, aligment, etc, it sometimes make
more sense to have a component that inverts control to the caller.

This means that we can extract out our business logic to a base component and
then have specialized components that utilize the inversion of control to create
a huge combination of different specializations/configurations. For exampe, we
could have a `Base Accordion` that implements some core business logic and the
rendering/extending can be left to a specialized implementation like
`Left aligned accordion` or `All can open acccordion`.

The benefits of this pattern are the following:

1. We no longer have to ship unncessary code to users -- people only get the
   code that's relevant to their use case
2. Our bundle sizes will drop considerabley because of number 1
3. We don't fall victim to the "it's only one more if statement" trap... if
   someone wants to extend our base component we expose the API'S they need to
   easily do this.
