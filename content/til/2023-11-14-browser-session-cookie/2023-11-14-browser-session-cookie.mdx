TIL that if you don't set a `max-age` or `expiration` attribute with a cookie
you're trying to set with `document.cookie`, the browser wil default to expiring
at the end of the session (when the browser is closed).

This isn't necessarily the case for all browsers, such as `Firefox` but most
browsers will default to this behavior.
