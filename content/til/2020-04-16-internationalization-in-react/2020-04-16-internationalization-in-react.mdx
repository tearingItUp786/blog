This technically isn't something that I learned "today" but it is something that
I wanted to make note of! If you're ever working on a project and need to
support internationalization, your library of choice— assuming you're writing in
React— should be

[react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/)!

Why? My coworker

[Vincent](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/vincent-sheu) wrote up a great ADR
(Architectural Decision Record) and evaluated the library and some of the
benefits it totes is...

1. It has a hooks implementation so there's no change needed to be made to the
   render portion (the view) of your React components.
2. It generates translation files in a directory that can be easily handed off
   to a translator to populate
3. There's enterprise options available if ye need em!
