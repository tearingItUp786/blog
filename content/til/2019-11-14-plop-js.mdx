So here is a nice little thing I'm going to try and get people using at work, I
hope! [PLOP js!](https://plopjs.com/)

It allows us to keep our project structure consistent by creating a CLI tool
that will help automate the creation of files that should exist for various
modules in our codebase. For example, if we are creating a `React` component, a
structure that we'd like to enforce in order to keep our project neat and tidy
is:

1. componentName > file name
2. componentName > index.js
3. componentName > \_\_tests\_\_
