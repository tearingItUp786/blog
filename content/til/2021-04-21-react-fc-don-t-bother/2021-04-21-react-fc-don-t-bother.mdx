`React.FC` was more meant to help beginners get more comfortable writing React
components with TS but honestly, the cons of using it (always having the ability
to pass `children` to your component even though you might not be rendering said
`children`) make me want to not use it.

If you're wanting to type `children`, you can do:

```tsx
type Props = {
	children?: React.ReactNode
}
```
