While making my way through a new React course, I learned that React elements
have a `$$typeof` property to help mitigate issues with XSS attacks.

In essence, the `$$typeof` prevents anyone from trying to get React to create
invalid elements via JSON. Even if a user passed in some JSON that mimicked what
a React Node looks like, the value of `$$typeof` is a `Symbol` and this cannot
be mocked by JSON!
