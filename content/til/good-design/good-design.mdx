While working my way through _The Pragmatic Programmer_ I came by a tip that really struck a
chord with me.

**Good design is easier to change than bad design.**

Make things _easier to change_. Why is decoupling good? By isolating concerns, we make each easier to change.
Why is the single responsibility principle good? A change in requirements is mirrored by a change in one module.
