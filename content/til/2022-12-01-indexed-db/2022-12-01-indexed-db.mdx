This technology has been around for a while (> 3 years) and I haven't used it
personally, but it's pretty damn slick. IndexedDB is a low-level API for client
side storage. Its more popular brother, `localStorage` has its limitations and
if you're ever running into them, you might want to take a look at `IndexedDB`.
In a nutshell, `IndexedDB` is a transactional database system that allows us to
permanently store data inside a user's browser. It would be useful for
applications that store a large amount of data and applications that don't need
persistent internet connectivity to function.

Keep these key things in mind:

- It stores key-value pairs.
- It's built on a transactional database model.
- The API is mostly async.
- It's object-oriented ðŸ˜².
- It's not SQL
- It adheres to the same origin policy.
