title: Ambient TS files (*.d.ts)

Alright, so I've been writing TS for a while and was never really sure why we
needed these `.d.ts` files... until today.

The purpose of these files is so that authors/the community can backport popular
JS libraries with TS type definitions. This allows library authors the freedom
to keep on writing their JS code but allows users of TS to benefit with working
code and the typings they need.

These typings probably exist in something like Definitely Typed. However, at
work, we're using a mix of JS and TS (JS is for the jest setup code) and
therefore we were required to have ambient TS files so that our TS test code
could benefit from the typings related to our JS files.

We are using module aliasing for our `TestUtils` so that we can do things like
`import { render } from 'TestUtils'`. Under the hood, the render function is
just a nicely wrapped render function from react-testing-library and so the
return types are the same. There was a bug where if I tried to import the
`RenderResult` from the testing library, VS code's TS language server would yell
at me for having an undefined module. The following code highlights the
fix/issue.

```ts:title=working.d.ts
// TYPESCRIPT IS A PAIN
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39040108/import-class-in-definition-file-d-ts/51114250#51114251
declare module "TestUtils" {
  export function render(
    v: any,
    other?: { initialState?: any }
  ): import("@testing-library/react").RenderResult
}
```

```ts:title=not-working.d.ts
// doesn't work
import { RenderResult } from "@testing-library/react"

declare module "TestUtils" {
  export function render(v: any, other?: { initialState?: any }): RenderResult
}
```
