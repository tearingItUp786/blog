So there's this really handy web api that allows you to create a lightweight
version of a Document and append nodes to said lightweight Document. The beauty
with this is you can create this tree, make changes to it, and then all at once
append the lightweight tree to the DOM.

This is much better than continually writing to the DOM and causing a shit ton
of reflows.
