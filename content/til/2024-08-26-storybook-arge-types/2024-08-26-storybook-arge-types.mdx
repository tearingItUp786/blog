TIL that Storybook has a way to specify the behavior of `args` -- `ArgeTypes`.
This is a great way to constrain the values that your component can accept and
provides information about `args` that aren't explicitly set in the story.

```tsx title="preview.ts"
// Replace your-renderer with the renderer you are using (e.g., react, vue3, angular, etc.)
import type {Preview} from '@storybook/your-renderer'

const preview: Preview = {
  argTypes: {
    // ðŸ‘‡ All stories expect a label arg
    label: {
      control: 'text',
      description: 'Overwritten description',
    },
  },
}

export default preview
```
