title: Collapsing Margins

So today at work I noticed that I was not getting the spacing I expected from
block level elements. The reason this was occuring was because my team and I
were relying on margins for spacing out elements, but we should have been
relying on padding instead.

Margins collapse in on each other (for siblings). If element A has a margin
bottom and element b is its sibling and underneath and has a margin top, we
would see the margin bottom of element A "collapse" (not be applied) and only
see the margin top of element B.
