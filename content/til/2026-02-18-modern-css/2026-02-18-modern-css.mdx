TIL about [modern-css.com](modern-css.com); it's a website meant to show us how to STOP writing CSS like it's 2015!
No more hacks; we have useful CSS properties we can apply now. Here's a freebie for you 😆:

```css {2-3}
/* babe, babe, it's so easy to center stuff now! */
display: grid;
place-items: center;
/* no more nasty transforms */
```
