This one's pretty sweet and I've been reaching for it a lot lately at work!
Rather than having multiple `className` conditions, you can use a
`data-attribute` to manage your state.

This is not only a _great_ way to keep your component clean but also allows you
to target any state pertinent to your component without JavaScript! Mind you,
I'm assuming you're using something like `Tailwind` for your styling.

```tsx
// no reliance on utility functions like `twMerge`
<div
	data-state-can-scroll={canScroll}
	className="data-[state-can-scroll=false]:hidden"
>
	Hidden when canScroll is false!
</div>
```
