import { ValidationDemo } from './validation-demo'

TIL about `:user-valid` and `:user-invalid` pseudo-class selectors! They function
similarly to `:valid` and `:invalid` but `:user-valid` and `:user-invalid` are only
applied only after a user has significantly interacted with the input.

In the example below, you'll notice that the first two inputs will not have
any border styling applied until the user has interacted with the input. Conversely,
the last two inputs will have border styling applied immediately ðŸ«¢.
