Ever run into the problem of having your `__tests__` directory sitting outside
of your `src` causing issues with TypeScript? I'm a big fan of colocating tests
but if you're ever working on a codebase that doesn't embrace this philosophy
and instead has a `__tests__` directory that sits at the same level as `src`,
you may need a a separate `tsconfig` for your tests.

This is possible thanks to the `-p` flag in TS and the fact that we can `extend`
tsconfig files. For the project in question, we used:

1. tsconfig.json
2. tsconfig.build.json
3. tsconfig.test.json
