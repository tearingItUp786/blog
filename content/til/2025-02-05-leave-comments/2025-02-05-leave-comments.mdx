More of a public service announcement and a reminder to myself (especially for
my personal projects), to leave comments on any funky things you're doing in
code. I wasted an hour battling a bug in my blog because I didn't leave a
comment regarding a `@ts-ignore` directive.

Leave. Comments. Please.
