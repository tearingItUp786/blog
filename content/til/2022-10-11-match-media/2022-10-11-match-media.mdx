My mind was blown today when I learned that browsers now ship with a native way
to easily check if the window matches a specific media query. 🤯

Essentially, you can pass in a media query into `window.matchMedia` and the
returned object will tell you if the window matches you media query. It also
ships with event listeners so you can handle resizing out of the box ❤️ .

Shout out to my main man Vepor for this piece of knowledge!
