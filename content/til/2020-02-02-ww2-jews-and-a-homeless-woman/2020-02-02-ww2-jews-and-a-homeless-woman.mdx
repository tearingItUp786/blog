I've always believed wholeheartedly in the following quote,

  A fool will learn nothing from a wise man. But a wise man will learn much from
  a fool.

Yesterday evening, I was approached by a visibly homeless woman and amidst her
musings about how Canada is a flawed nation where people are left to suffer as
corporate greed consumes the very essence of the city and about how one doesn't
necessarily need a highschool education to be intelligent, she dropped a nugget
of wisdom on me that I'll carry with me for quite some time.

According to this woman, and I googled this after to make sure that it was in
fact true, the people of Denmark actively assisted in helping Jewish Danes
[escape from Hitler by evacuating them to neutral Sweden.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews)

By no means am I saying that this woman is a fool; please don't misunderstand
me. What I'm trying to hit home with this TIL is that wisdom can come from
anywhere, whether it's a college professor or a homeless woman who, and I can't
make this up, began urinating in her pants mid conversation... everyone has got
something to offer.
