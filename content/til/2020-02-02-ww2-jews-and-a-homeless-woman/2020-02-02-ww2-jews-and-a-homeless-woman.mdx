I've always believed wholeheartedly in the following quote,

> A fool will learn nothing from a wise man. But a wise man will learn much from
  a fool.

Yesterday evening, I was approached by a visibly homeless woman and amidst her musings about how Canada is a flawed
nation where people are left to suffer as corporate greed consumes the very essence of the city and
about how one doesn't necessarily need a highschool education to be intelligent, she dropped a nugget of wisdom on me
that I'll carry with me for quite some time.

According to this woman, and I googled this after to make sure that it was in fact
true, the people of Denmark actively assisted in helping Jewish Danes <TextLink href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews">
escape from Hitler by evacuating them to neutral Sweden.</TextLink>

By no means am I saying that this woman is a fool; please don't misunderstand me. What I'm trying to hit home
with this TIL is that wisdom can come from anywhere, whether it's a college professor or a homeless woman who,
and I can't make this up, began urinating in her pants mid conversation... everyone has got something to offer.
