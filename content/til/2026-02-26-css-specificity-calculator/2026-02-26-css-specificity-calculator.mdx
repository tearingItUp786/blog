TIL about a handy mathematical formula for determining and calculating CSS specificity. It's a triad: A, B, C.

A is `id`-like (#main), B is `class`-like (.yolo), and C is `element`-like (div). It's often represented as (A, B, C) notation. There are
even handy calculators to use online!

```CSS
/* (0, 0, 1) */
p { color: red; }

/* (0, 1, 0) */
.intro { color: blue; }

/* (0, 1, 1) */
p.intro { color: green; }

/* (1, 0, 0) */
#main { color: purple; }

```
