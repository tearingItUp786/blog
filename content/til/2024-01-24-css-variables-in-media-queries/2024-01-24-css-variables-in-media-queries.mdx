title: CSS variables in media queries
date: 2024-01-24
tag: CSS

We tried to use some CSS variables we defined inside of the `:root` with our
tailwind config and even though tailwind let's you do that, the outputted CSS
isn't actually valid ðŸ¤¯! The media query declarations are processed while our
CSS is being parsed!

```css:title=wont-work.css
:root {
	--mobile-breakpoint: 600px;
	--tablet-breakpoint: 900px;
}

/* This gets processed before the CSS is parsed */
/* So the media query is invalid */
@media(max-width: var(--mobile-breakpoint)) {
	.showMeGoing {
    visibility: visible;
  }
}
```
