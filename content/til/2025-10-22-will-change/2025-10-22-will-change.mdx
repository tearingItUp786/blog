TIL about `will-change` in CSS. It's a way to hint to browsers that certain CSS properties of an element
are likely to change. It's mostly used for animations, but it can be used for other things too.

It should be noted that it should be used `sparingly` but if you're ever coming across a janky animation,
remember that you should be animating transforms and opacities and maybe throw in a `will-change` for good measure.
Maybe even consider removing `will-change` after animations complete, since leaving it on can waste memory.
