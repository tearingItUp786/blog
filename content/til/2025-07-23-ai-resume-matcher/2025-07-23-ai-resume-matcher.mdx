TIL about [Resume Matcher](https://resumematcher.fyi/), a full stack web app, that you have to run locally,
that will reveal your resumes compatibility score and crucial keywords ðŸ˜Ž.

It's still in active development, and to be honest, I had to do a little finagling to get it to work locally,
but I'm really excited to see how it evolves. With the resumes I've used and job descriptions I've uploaded,
I think the original scores that I got were pretty good but the updates the app suggested, like adding numerical
data and percentages, definitely would have improved the overall appeal of my resume.
