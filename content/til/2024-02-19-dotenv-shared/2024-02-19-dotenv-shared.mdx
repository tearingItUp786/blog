TIL about [dotenv.org](https://www.dotenv.org/pricing/)! You can use this to
share and sync your `.env` files across machines/teammates. They also allow for
the ability to encrypt your secrets and use them in your CI/CD pipelines.

The neat thing about this if someone leaves your company and you don't have a
fancy IT setup, you can just change the keys on the `dotenv` side of things and
the keys the user has on their local machine will no longer be valid!
