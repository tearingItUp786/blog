Today I learned about Supabase, an open source alternative to Firebase.
It being open source also means I can self-host it, which I love ❤️.

But anyways, I played around with it this weekend in an attempt to build out a proof of concept
for a course platform I want to build out for my Brazilian Jujutsu business, and I have to say I'm quite impressed 🤯.
