After being laid off from Productboard, I've been spending time thinking about
how I want to continue with my career and what to do with my spare time. Of
course landing a job is my priority, but during my time off, I want to devote
time to learning skills and technology that I've never been able to make the
time for in the past.

One thing I've always wanted to do (for the "by the way factor") was setting up
vim for my local development work. I devoted the entire day today to set up my
neovim config; I'm pretty happy with it so far.
