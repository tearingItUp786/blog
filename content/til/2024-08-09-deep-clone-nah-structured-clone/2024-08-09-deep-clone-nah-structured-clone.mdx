TIL that if we want to make a `deepClone` of an object in JS, there's a built in
method in most browsers: `structuredClone`!

The old one (which works but doesn't account for things like `Set` and `Map` or
even `Date`)

```js:title=the-old-and-new-way
const originalObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  date: new Date(),
  details: {
    hobbies: ["reading", "gaming"],
    address: {
      city: "New York",
      zip: "10001",
    },
  },
};

const clonedObjectOldWay = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));

// what do you think happened to the date? üòè
// hint... no longer a string!
console.log(clonedObjectOldWay);

console.log(originalObject.date instanceof Date); // true
console.log(clonedObjectOldWay.date instanceof Date); // false (Date is not preserved)

```

Shout out to [Matt Pocock](https://www.totaltypescript.com/) -- the person
behind Total Typescript -- for the twitter thread that exposed me to this
function!
