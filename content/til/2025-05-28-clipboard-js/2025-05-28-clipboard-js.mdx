TIL about [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/), a library that allows you to copy text to the clipboard.

It's pretty simple to use, it's also pretty lightweight, and it's declarative af.

```html
<!-- Target -->
<input id="foo" value="https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js.git" />

<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-target="#foo">
	<img src="assets/clippy.svg" alt="Copy to clipboard" />
</button>
```
