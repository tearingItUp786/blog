When it comes to managing npm packages for your organization, there' a great little package
called <TextLink href="https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio">Verdaccio</TextLink>

Verdaccio is a light-weight npm proxy registry. It allows us to **host private Node.js packages**
and is compatible with all client package managers, such as Yarn and npm. There's even a `Docker`
image you can use to get you up and running!
