title: Axios and Content-Type

During work today, my colleague Mo and I were having issues making `DELETE` requests to a
micro service that he had created. In Postman and the standard XHR function that ships with
Google Chrome, the delete requests were going through with no problem but when we tried to make a call
via `axios.delete(url/id)`, the server kept returning a 400 error.

The truly peculiar thing was that making a call in the following manner worked:

```js
axios({
  method: "DELETE",
  url: `url/${id}`,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer SOME_TOKEN",
  },
})
```

However, this failed:

```js
axios.delete(`url/${id}`, {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: "Bearer SOME_TOKEN",
  },
})
```

Long story short, TIL: `axios.delete` will drop the content-type header (which is the right behavior) so
my buddy Mo had to change up his micro service endpoint to not expect a content type 😁!
