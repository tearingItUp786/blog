It's okay to be scared, but, be not afraid. Being scared is a reaction to an
event; it's an ephemeral feeling. Be scared when something pops out of a haunted
house, but, be not afraid of ghosts. Be scared when you are about to go give a
presentation but be not afraid of speaking your mind.

It's okay -- being scared alerts you, wakes you up, and brings danger to your
awareness. Being afraid though? This is a state of being. It weakens you, drags
you down, and sometimes, paralyzes you.

**Be not afraid.**
