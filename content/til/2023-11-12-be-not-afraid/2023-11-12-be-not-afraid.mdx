It's okay to be scared, but, be not afraid. Being scared is a reaction to an event; it's an ephemeral feeling. 
Be scared of when something pops out of a haunted house, but, be not afraid of ghosts. Be scared when you are 
about to go give a presentation but be not afraid of speaking your mind. 

It's okay -- being scared alerts you, wakes you up, and brings danger to your awareness. Being afraid though? 
This is a state of being. It weakens you, drags you down, and sometimes, paralyzes you. 

**Be not afraid.**
