TypeScript's compiler is being reimagined.
Currently at version 5.8, TypeScript is still written in TypeScript itself,
but there are plans to port it to Go for version 7.

This change promises to improve compilation timesâ€”by up to 10 times faster! True, the speed bost
is something we probably won't see for a few months or years, but I'm super excited to see `Go`
get some much needed love and attention, since you know, it's my secondary language of choice.
