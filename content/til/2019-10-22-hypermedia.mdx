In the Rest maturity model, Hypermedia is considered to be the most mature --
the highest level.

0. The swamp of Pox (XML)
1. Resources
1. HTTP Verbs
1. Hypermedia

In a nutshell, Hypermedia has REST endpoints expose links to other related data.
For instance, if there was an endpoint that existed to fetch all the products in
a particular catalog, each product resource in the payload would have a `_links`
property that had attributes that would allow users of the API via `self` to
navigate to the respected product. Just by visiting products, I'd have a way of
getting to a specific product without having to store the API endpoint in my
source code; the initial API call would prove it to me.

```json:title=products.json
{
  "_embedded": {
    "products": [
      {
        "title": "Navy blue stone wash jeans",
        "seller": "Revtown Jeans",
        "_links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "/products/42"
          }
        }
      }
      // more products ...
    ]
  }
}
```
