Encapsulation in the web is hard (especially when it comes to CSS)... thank god
for the Shadow DOM.

The Shadow DOM allows us the ability to keep the markup structure, styling, and
behavior (JS) so that different parts of the application do not clash. This is
entirely important for a micro frontend architecture -- **we do not want style
clashing**.

My colleague Danny and I were able to utilize the Shadow DOM and Single SPA to
create an encapsulated navbar. üòÅ
