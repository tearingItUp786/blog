Encapsulation in the web is hard (especially when it comes to CSS)... thank god for the Shadow DOM.

The Shadow DOM allows us the ability to keep the markup structure, styling, and behavior (JS) so that different
parts of the application do not clash. This is entirely important for a micro frontend architecture -- **we do not want style clashing**.

My colleague Danny and I were able to utilize the Shadow DOM and Single SPA to create an encapsulated navbar. 😁
