Today I learned about the `with` method on the `Array.prototype` object. This
method is used to create a shallow copy of an array but with one element
replaced at a given index.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
const newArr = arr.with(0, 5)

console.log(arr) // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArr) // [5, 2, 3]
```

This is useful when you want to replace elements in an array without mutating
the original array.
