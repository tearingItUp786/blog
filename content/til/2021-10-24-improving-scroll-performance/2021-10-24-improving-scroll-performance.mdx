Turns out there's a way to improve event listeners that are tied to the
scrolling event in the browser.

```javascript
const onScroll = e => console.log('sup', e)
window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll, {passive: true})
```

This will make it so that our scroll handler will not block the main thread
(yay!).
