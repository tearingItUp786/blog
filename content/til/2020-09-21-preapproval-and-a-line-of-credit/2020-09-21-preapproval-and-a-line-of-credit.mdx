TIL it's better to apply for a limit increase on a line of credit (LOC) if
there's a legitimate reason that this increase is required. Regardless of the
approval of the LOC increase, one's credit score takes a hit so it makes sense
to try and increase one's odds of being approved.

Having a reason for a limit increase (like a home reno) is more likely to get
approved than someone who just wants some more backup funds.
