While working on a javascript monorepos course, I was exposed to
[Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/).

Volta eases the node development process by allowing developers to easily pin
node versions to a project and will automatically switch the development machine
to the right version when switching between contexts ðŸ˜ƒ.
