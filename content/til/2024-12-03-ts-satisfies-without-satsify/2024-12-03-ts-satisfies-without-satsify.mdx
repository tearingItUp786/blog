TIL about how one can use `satisfies` in typescript, without `satisfy` at all!

```typescript
// taken right from Kent's blog
type OperationFn = (left: number, right: number) => number

// this is a restriction on the operations object
// but with satisfies, I leave myself room to add more operations and don't need to manage another type
const operations = {
	'+': (left, right) => left + right,
	'-': (left, right) => left - right,
	'*': (left, right) => left * right,
	'/': (left, right) => left / right,
} satisfies Record<string, OperationFn>
```
