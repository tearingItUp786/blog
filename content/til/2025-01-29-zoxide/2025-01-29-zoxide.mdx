Til about `zoxide` which is a faster and more robust `cd` alternative; i lets
you navigate your filesystem faster and more reliably.

```bash:title=zoxide-examples
 z ~/Documents/new-blog
 z ~/Documents/rehype-code-titles

# Go back to the last directory (new-blog)
z -

# Go to the `new-blog` directory
z rehype-code-titles

# Go back to your home directory
z

# open a fzf menu of possible entries that being with `re`
zi re<SPACE><TAB>
```
