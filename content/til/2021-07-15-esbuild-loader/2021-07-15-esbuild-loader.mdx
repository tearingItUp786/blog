There's been a lot of new developments in the space of package bundlers. From
the OG [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to, [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to
the new kid on the block [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) each of
them have their own unique set of features.

esbuild offers better build times as it is written in Go, which is compiled to
JavaScript. The tradeoff here is that es5 isn't supported (but that's okay if
you're not supporting IE11). It's pretty awesome but as it's in active
development and fairly new, it's not as widely used as the other bundlers and
therefore doesn't have the rich plugin resource that somethings like webpack
has.

However, you can leverage esbuild and plug it into a webpack config and via
[esbuild-loader](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader) I did this at
work today and it helped with devserver startup times and greatly improved the
production build times.
