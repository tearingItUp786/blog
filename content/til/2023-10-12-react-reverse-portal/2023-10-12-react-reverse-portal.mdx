Not gonna lie, I'll probably never need to reach for this tool 😂, but I heard about it while watching
a video on Youtube and thought it was cool. `react-reverse-portal` allows you to render a react node 
and then take it out of the dom entirely and return it later, without having to unmount the component. 
It's pretty neat!
