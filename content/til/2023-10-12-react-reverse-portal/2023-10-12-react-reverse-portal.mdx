Not gonna lie, I'll probably never need to reach for this tool ðŸ˜‚, but I heard
about it while watching a video on Youtube and thought it was cool.
`react-reverse-portal` allows you to render a react node and then take it out of
the dom entirely and return it later, without having to unmount the component.
It's pretty neat!
