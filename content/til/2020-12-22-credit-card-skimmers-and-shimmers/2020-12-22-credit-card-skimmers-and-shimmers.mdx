TIL that there are credit card scams around like skimmers and shimmers that
oftentimes show up at gas station pumps and other brick-and-mortar shops.

To avoid being a victim, do not pay at the pump if they require you to insert
the card at the pump (these pumps can be tampered with whilst the inside card
reader most likely will not be). **Pay with tap when you can**

Also, don't forget to check your transactions regularly and check out free
credit reporting services like Borrowell.
