TIL about `ts-reset` - it's like CSS resets but for TypeScript! Shout out to Matt Pocock (and the team) for this!

Here's an example of one of the rules:

```tsx
// AFTER
import '@total-typescript/ts-reset/array-includes'

const users = ['matt', 'sofia', 'waqas'] as const

// .includes now takes a string as the first parameter
// BEFORE, it would have complained about the type of the first parameter
users.includes('bryan')
```

There are way more rules so I encourage you to give it a read and maybe incorporate it into your project!
