title: Ambient TS files (*.d.ts)

import { MDXTextLink as TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps"

Alright, so I've been writing TS for a while and was never really sure why we needed
these `.d.ts` files... until today.

The purpose of these files is so that authors/the community can backport popular JS libraries with TS
type definitions. This allows library authors the freedom to keep on writing their JS code but allows
users of TS to benefit with working code and the typings they need.

These typings probably exist in something like Definitely Typed. However, at work, we're using a mix of JS
and TS (JS is for the jest setup code) and therefore we were required to have ambient TS files so that
our TS test code could benefit from the typings related to our JS files.

We are using module aliasing for our `TestUtils` so that we can do things like `import { render } from 'TestUtils'`.
Under the hood, the render function is just a nicely wrapped render function from react-testing-library and so the
return types are the same. There was a bug where if I tried to import the `RenderResult` from the testing library,
VS code's TS language server would yell at me for having an undefined module. The following code highlights the fix/issue.

```ts:title=working.d.ts
// TYPESCRIPT IS A PAIN

declare module "TestUtils" {
  export function render(
    v: any,
    other?: { initialState?: any }
  ): import("@testing-library/react").RenderResult
}
```

```ts:title=not-working.d.ts
// doesn't work
import { RenderResult } from "@testing-library/react"

declare module "TestUtils" {
  export function render(v: any, other?: { initialState?: any }): RenderResult
}
```
