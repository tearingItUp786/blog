Alright, I'm not the greatest at CSS, but I respect those people, such as
`Josh Comeau` that are! TIL (from reading his blog post) the following about
some CSS attributes and how they relate to grid:

- `justify`: deals with _columns_
- `align`: deals with _rows_
- `content`: deals with the _grid struture_
- `items`: deals with the _DOM nodes_ within the grid structure

For example, `align-items: center` can loosely be translated into:
`In the context of the row, these DOM nodes, center them... bro`. Seriously, go
read his article.
