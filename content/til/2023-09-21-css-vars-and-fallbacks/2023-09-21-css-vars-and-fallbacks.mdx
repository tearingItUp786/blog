TIL that css `var` can accept a fallback! If we're setting the variable with some JS 
and this JS code for some reason or another fails to run, we can set a sensible fallback 
and present our users with at least _something_ adjacent to what we wanted😊!

```css
  color: var(--someVariable, #888888);
```
