import { TextLink } from "../../../src/components/mdx-comps";

`React.FC` was more meant to help beginners get more comfortable writing
React components with TS but honestly, the cons of using it (always having the ability
to pass `children` to your component even though you might not be rendering said `children`)
make me want to not use it.

If you're wanting to type `children`, you can do:

```tsx
type Props = {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
};
```
