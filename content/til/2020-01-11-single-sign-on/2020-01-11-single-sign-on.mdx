Single sign-on (SSO) is a property of access control of multiple related, yet
indepdent records. Thanks to this property, users can log in with a single ID
and password to gain access to any of several related systems.

If you're working in a corporate setting, this is how you're able to seamlessly
switch between applications (maybe in the browser) and not have to log in
despite the fact that all these systems have some sort of authentication and
authorization piece associated with them.
