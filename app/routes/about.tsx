          Hey there, thanks for stopping by. I'm a self-taught software engineer
          with over six years of experience and I am based out of Vancouver,
          Canada. I've got a passion for Typescript in both the Frontend and the
          Backend. If you'd like to hear about how I went from being someone
          with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration to a Software
          Engineer, feel free to reach out to me on{' '}
          <TextLink href="https://twitter.com/tearingItUp786">twitter</TextLink>
          ; I'd be more than happy to walk you through my journey.
        </p>
        <H3>Start with why</H3>
        <p>
          My <span className="text-accent">why?</span> I want to improve the
          lives of all those who come across my path.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to go into why I started this website; I am sure that you
          can ascertain my motivations (staying up-to-date on my skills, fun,
          etc). If I had to distill it down to a single point, however, it is
          that I want to be able to share my knowledge with the world. There are
          thousands upon thousands of these websites that have been created by
          thousands of amazing developers, many of whom are much better than I
          at software development. However, I strive to go beyond just software
          development; I want to provide a place to distribute as much knowledge
          as I can on a myriad of topics. That's why this is the home for{' '}
          <strong>"mostly"</strong> my developer thoughts; I've given myself
          room to take the conversation elsewhere.

              I've learned many things from my old man, but this is one of the
              most important lessons that I've learned from him. No matter where
              you end up, no matter what you do, you are directly responsible
              for how you respond and how you move forward. I choose to move
              forward with the best intentions in my heart and I will always
              take responsibility for the decisions and choices I make.

              While working solo has its benefits, I've found some of the
              greatest work I've done in my career was produced, in part, thanks
              to effective collaboration. I've been fortunate enough to work
              with some amazing folks over the years and I've learned a lot from
              them. Designers, engineers, product owners, etc. I've learned from
              each and every one of them. No one can have all the answers...
              that's why we work together with folks! Two heads are better than
              one.
